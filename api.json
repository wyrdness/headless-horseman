      "full": "The Headless Horseman is one of America's most iconic ghost stories, popularized by Washington Irving's 1820 tale 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.' The character is described as a Hessian soldier who lost his head to a cannonball during the Revolutionary War and now haunts the area around Sleepy Hollow (Tarrytown), New York. The ghost rides a black horse at night, particularly near a covered bridge, and throws either a pumpkin or his severed head at victims. While inspired by European folklore, particularly the Irish Dullahan, Irving's version became the definitive American ghost legend, symbolizing Revolutionary War trauma and the adaptation of immigrant folklore to the New World."
